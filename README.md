# 18F Guides

A work in progress repository for consolidating the 18F Guides and Methods.

## How do I update this content?

The [CODEOWNERS file](.github/CODEOWNERS) keeps track of who is in review & approver roles for content in this repository — if you’re not receiving a timely (within two weeks) review or notice the list is outdated, reach out to 18F’s Chief of Delivery for assistance. These reviewers will be automatically tagged appropriately when opening pull requests. 

## Development
The re-platformed sites use 11ty. If you could run Jekyll, you should be able to run 11ty! There are two approaches to working with the guides: [Local installation](#local-installation) and [Codespaces](#codespaces).


Ensure that you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. 

To run the site locally:

1. Clone this repo
2. From the repo directory, run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:8080

### Codespaces
[Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) allows you to set up a development environment easily and without dependencies on a local machine.

#### Start a GitHub Codespace
1. From this repo, Click "Code" and then the "Codespaces" tab.
2. Click the "+" icon, agree to the terms.
3. You should then see the repo interface. At the bottom, check the branch you are currently viewing or create a new one.

#### Start the application and preview the site
1. Give this a few minutes to warm up. At first, it will have a message "Welcome to Codespaces."  If you wait a bit, you'll see it recognize the environment and start to install libraries for you.
2. Once it finishes installing the libraries, click on the "terminal" and type ```npm start```. 
3. It will think for 10 - 20 seconds and then you should see a message pop up on the right side that the site is available.  Click "open in the browser.

#### Make changes, preview them
1. Select a file from the file explorer that you want to edit.  Make some changes!  You should be able to refresh the preview tab to see them immediately. If you will be making changes to styles, you will need to restart the server via ```npm run dev``` for those to be reflected.

#### Commit your changes
1. When you’re happy with how things look, switch on the left-hand menu to the "sourcecode" view. It will show you any changes you have made. Click the file name (on the left) to view things you've removed/added to that file.
2. This is a good time to create a new branch if you haven't already started on one!  Click the three dots at the top of that menu, then "Branch" then "Create Branch".  Give it a name like "design-update" or "cool-new-footer" and hit enter.
3. You will need to stage each file that you want to be committed. Once that's done, it's time to commit and push!  You can click "commit" and then "publish" or you can use the arrow to select "commit & push".
4. On the lower right, it will ask you if you want to create a pull request.  If it's too soon, don't click this.  Otherwise, feel free!

### Accessibility Scanning
We use `pa11y-ci` is used to scan for accessibility issues. The scan runs as part of
our CI setup (see the [pull-request.yml workflow](.github/workflows/pull-request.yml))
on every pull request, but it can also be run locally. To run locally, type:
```
npm run test:pa11y-ci
```
### Code Formatting ###
  
#### Prettier ####
We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. You can run prettier manually with
```
npx prettier . --write
```
Note that this will overwrite files in place. See `npx prettier --help` for more CLI options.
  
An easier way to use prettier is to integrate it into your IDE/editor. For example, [integration exists for VS Code](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) such that prettier runs on a file every time you save it.
  
You can also add prettier as a [git commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), but you will need to set up the script yourself. For example, you can symlink [this template](/utils/pre-commit) file into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
